# Xash4DS
An edit of Xash3DS to update it to the latest version of Xash3D-FWGS and attempt to improve it further from its current state.

Current project list:
- update the underlying Xash3D engine to the latest version of Xash3D-FWGS (right now, commit 8090db2 02/02/2021)
- an actual touch-screen interface that lets you use auxiliary controls easier (right now it's the exact same as ctrQuake)
- better performnace on old 3DS (since it is the only 3DS I own I cry evry tim)
- optimizing the in-game settings menu to be more pertinant to the port and possibly adding some touch screen customization too
- better mod support to hopefully enable a counter-strike port in the near future

Things that *could* happen but I'm not betting on right now
- turning all the in-game menus into brand new menus that make use of the 3DS touch screen
- wireless local multiplayer, possibly through download play idfk
